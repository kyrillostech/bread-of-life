🚀 **Launching: Bread of Life (خبز الحياة) - A Spiritual Tech Journey** ✝️💻

I am thrilled to share my latest open-source project, **Bread of Life**, a web application designed to help you journey through the entire Bible with consistency and depth.

🔍 **What makes it special?**
*   **Authentic Experience:** Designed with a "Glass Monastic" aesthetic that reflects our Coptic Orthodox heritage.
*   **Smart Planning:** Choose a 1-year or 2-year plan, and the app serves you a balanced daily diet of Old and New Testament readings.
*   **Spiritual Companion:** Features daily quotes from the Church Fathers, Coptic dates, and a streak counter to keep you motivated.
*   **Tech Stack:** Built with pure Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for maximum performance and compatibility.

🌍 **Open Source for the World**
I believe technology can serve faith. That's why I've made this project **Open Source**! I invite developers from around the world to contribute, learn, and help spread the Word.

"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
